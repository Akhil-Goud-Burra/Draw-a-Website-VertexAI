# Draw-a-Website-VertexAI

In this lab, I will build a web application that allows users to generate website code (html, css, and javascript) from wireframes and prompts that the user enters using Vertex AI's Generative AI Models (Gemini 1.5 Flash, Gemini 1.5 Pro, etc.). The application will be built using Flask, a popular Python web framework, and will use the Vertex AI client library to interact with the Generative Models service.
