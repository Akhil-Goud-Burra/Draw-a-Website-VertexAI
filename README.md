# Draw-a-Website-VertexAI
In this lab, I will build a web application that allows users to generate website code (html, css, and javascript) from wireframes and prompts that the user enters using Vertex AI's Generative AI Models (Gemini 1.5 Flash, Gemini 1.5 Pro, etc.). The application will be built using Flask, a popular Python web framework, and will use the Vertex AI client library to interact with the Generative Models service.

# What I will build
I will have a working web application that can generate images from wireframes and prompts. You will also have a better understanding of how to use Vertex AI's Generative AI models.

# How the App flows
1. Upload a Hand-Drawn Wireframe: Users can upload an image of their hand-drawn wireframe to the app.
2. Select a Model: The app provides a selection of pre-trained Gemini models optimized for different design styles.
3. Provide a Prompt: Users can optionally provide a text prompt to guide the model's generation.
4. Generate Website Code: The app sends the wireframe and prompt to Gemini, which generates the corresponding website code.
5. Display the Result: The generated code is displayed in the app's response page.
